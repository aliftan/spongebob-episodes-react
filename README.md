# SpongeBob Episodes Explorer

This project is a React application that demonstrates efficient handling of large datasets with custom filtering and virtualized rendering. It showcases SpongeBob SquarePants episodes with advanced filtering capabilities and optimized performance.

## Key Features

1. **Large Dataset Handling**: Efficiently manages a large dataset of SpongeBob episodes.

2. **Advanced Filtering**: 
   - Title search
   - Multi-select filters for seasons, writers, copyright years, and characters
   - Real-time filtering with debounced updates

3. **Virtualized Rendering**: 
   - Uses `react-window` for efficient rendering of large lists
   - Implements infinite scrolling with `react-window-infinite-loader`

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Memoized components and callbacks
   - Debounced filter updates
   - Lazy loading of episode cards

5. **Responsive UI**: 
   - Built with Chakra UI for a clean, responsive design
   - Grid layout for filter sidebar and main content

6. **Loading States**: 
   - Skeleton loaders for episode cards during filtering
   - Display of filtering time and episode count

## Technical Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Chakra UI
- react-window & react-window-infinite-loader for virtualization
- react-virtualized-auto-sizer for responsive sizing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Performance Considerations

- The app uses memoization and virtualization to handle large datasets efficiently
- Filtering is optimized with debounced updates to reduce unnecessary re-renders
- Lazy loading is implemented for episode cards to improve initial load time

## Future Improvements

- Implement server-side filtering for even larger datasets
- Add sorting functionality
- Enhance accessibility features
- Implement unit and integration tests

This project demonstrates best practices for handling large datasets in React applications, showcasing efficient filtering, virtualization, and performance optimization techniques.
